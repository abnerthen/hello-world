# hello-world

Hi guys.

My name is Kyle. I'm 15 years old this year. I'm from Thailand. I go to an international school. I will be taking the International General Certificate of Secondary Education next year. I hope to become a lawyer. I plan to go study in the University of Oxford after I graduate from secondary school. I learn coding for fun. I'm just randomly saying things here so that space gets filled up.
